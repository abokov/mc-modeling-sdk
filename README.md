# mc-modeling-sdk
Processes and data modeling framework based on Monte-Carlo simulation and historical data, now on c++, multi-platform and Azure-enabled

# How does it work

Monte Carlo simulation performs risk analysis by building models of possible results by substituting a range of values—a probability distribution—for any factor that has inherent uncertainty. It then calculates results over and over, each time using a different set of random values from the probability functions. Depending upon the number of uncertainties and the ranges specified for them, a Monte Carlo simulation could involve thousands or tens of thousands of recalculations before it is complete.
Using this SDK you can Monte-Carlo simulation on requires number of recalculations and use customuzed type of random generation model. From practical point of view you can use it as using [MonteCarlo class](../master/mc-kernel/simulation.h), [stand-alone binary](tree/master/docs) or call it from [java via JNI](tree/master/demo_jni)
